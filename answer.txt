1. What is the purpose of the .git directory?
   → It stores all version history, branches, and configuration data for the repository.

2. Difference between git pull and git fetch:
   → git fetch downloads changes without merging.
     git pull downloads and merges changes into your current branch.

3. Purpose of the staging area:
   → It’s where changes are prepared before committing.

4. Command to unstage a file:
   → git restore --staged <filename>

5. git revert vs git reset:
   → git revert creates a new commit that undoes previous changes.
     git reset moves the branch pointer backward (can change history).

6. Steps to invite a collaborator:
   → Go to the repository on GitHub → Settings → Collaborators → Add their GitHub username → Send invitation.

7. Command to list all branches:
   → git branch -a

8. Check differences between working directory and last commit:
   → git diff

9. Importance of meaningful commit messages:
   → They explain what and why you changed something, helping collaboration and debugging.

10. What happens if you push without committing:
   → Nothing is pushed — Git only pushes committed changes.
